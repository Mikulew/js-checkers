## General info

**STATUS: WIP**

**Draughts** (_/drɑːfts, dræfts/; British English_) or **checkers** (_American English_) is a group of [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game) [board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from [alquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque). The name _draughts_ derives from the verb to draw or to move, whereas _checkers_ derives from the checkered board which the game is played on.
